Milvus is a cloud-native, open-source vector database built to manage embedding vectors generated by machine learning models and neural networks. It extends the capabilities of best-in-class approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search libraries (e.g. Faiss, NMSLIB, Annoy) and features on-demand scalability, and high availability. The goal of Milvus is to simplify unstructured data management and provide a consistent experience across different deployment environments. Milvus is widely used in different scenarios, and has been adopted by over 1,000 organizations worldwide.

Milvus was released under the open-source Apache License 2.0 in October 2019, and its source code was made available on GitHub. In June 2021, Milvus graduated from the LF AI & Data Foundation's incubator program.
